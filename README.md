# Emergency Vehicle Classification using TensorFlow

This project involves a simple yet effective codebase utilizing the TensorFlow library for the classification of emergency vehicle objects. The supported categories include:

- Police vehicles
- Fire trucks
- Ambulances
- Army trucks
- Unmarked police vehicles
- Cars

The neural network has been trained on a dataset comprising cropped photos of these vehicles, enabling it to accurately classify and distinguish between different emergency vehicle types.
